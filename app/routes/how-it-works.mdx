# How it works


## Class name overrides

Under the hood Yogi UI uses [tailwind-merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge) to ensure the proper class names are applied.

A component implementation might look like this:

```jsx
import classNames from 'classnames';
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge';

export default function Heading({ children, className }) {
  return (
    <h1 className={twMerge(classNames('text-xl text-gray-600', className))}>
      {children}
    </h1>
  )
}
```

Which means when you call this in your app you will get the default styling:

```jsx
<Heading>My Heading</Heading>
```

But when you want more control, you can specify other classes you may need, including any that conflict with the default ones we provide.

```jsx
{/* applies the classes text-4xl text-gray-600 underline */}
<Heading className={'text-4xl underline'}>My New Heading</Heading>
```

## Color schemes / Dynamic class names

Yogi UI provides an API that allows you to pass the name of a color (any valid color in your tailwind config) and have the component apply the appropriate weighted styles.

For example, take a stripped down version of how the button component is implemented:

```jsx
function Button({ children, colorScheme = 'cyan' }) {
  return (
    <button className={`bg-${colorScheme}-600 hover:bg-${colorScheme}-500 text-white`}>
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

This gives us a clean API that provides balanced colors among the text, background, border, and hover states without needing to
rewrite the full class list everytime.

```jsx
<Button>Cyan Button</Button>

<Button colorScheme={'indigo'}>Indigo Button</Button>
```

However this won't work out of the box in Tailwind due to the way it produces the compiled CSS.

Tailwind generates classes by searching through the paths specified in the `content` array in `tailwind.config.json` looking for any string
that matches a certain regex for their schema, eg `bg-blue-400`, and only generates the classes that it finds.

This is crucial because of the sheer amount of classes tailwind can generate (including variants, etc) could be huge, so they only want
to generate the classes actually being used in your project.

Unfortunately for this library, that means it can't detect things like `bg-${colorScheme}-400` as it doesn't know what `colorScheme` is supposed to be!

In order to get around this, we need to utilize Tailwind's `safelist` API to make sure the proper classes get generated.

By default, Yogi UI generates the classes it needs by using the `yogiSafelist` helper provided

```js
// tailwind.config.js
const { yogiSafelist } = require('yogi-ui');

module.exports = {
  // ... etc
  safelist: [
    ...yogiSafelist()
  ]
}
```

This generates the required `bg-*-*`, `text-*-*`, and `border-*-*` classes for the colors the default theme uses. If you are going
to be using other colors in your app, such as one of the other defaults like `slate` or `violet`, or perhaps you have your own colors
configured like `brand` or `primary`, you can add them as a config option to that function call

```js
// tailwind.config.js
const { yogiSafelist } = require('yogi-ui');

module.exports = {
  // ... etc
  safelist: [
    ...yogiSafelist({ colors: ['brand', 'violet'] })
  ]
}
```

This is a less than optimal way to handle this but unfortunately it is the only path forward I see that lets us maintain the nice API.

At the end of the day this may result in +/ 50kb css, which isn't terrible.
